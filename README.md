# VBA-challenge

This dataset includes an excel file containing stock market data for several years. 
Each row in the dataset represents a stock on one day, and includes ticker symbol, date, opening/closing prices, high/low prices, and volume sold.

This VBA code will create a summary table within the same worksheet for each stock that includes:
- ticker symbol
- yearly change (with conditional formatting to show increase or decrease)
- percent change (with conditional formatting to show increase or decrease)
- total stock volume

The code then summarizes the following data for each year:
- which stock had greatest percent increase
- which stock had greatest percent decrease
- which stock had greatest total volume
